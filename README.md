# Noise-suppression-using-deep-learning
This work has an efficient noise detection/ suppression algorithm that works on the principles of deep learning, specifically CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks), and tests the performance of the CNN model for different optimizers. Noise reduction removes unwanted noise while preserving the source sound. Source sounds can be speech, music played from devices such as iPods and computers, or no sound at all. The presence of noise in audio signals creates major problems in speech recognition, enhancement, enhancement and transmission work.
